# Common Misconceptions About Technical Writersâ€”and the Truth

---

## ðŸ’¬ "ChatGPT can write documentation or LLMs can generate content for me. We donâ€™t need you."

**Answer:**  
AI can assist with drafting content, but it **lacks product knowledge** and cannot ensure **accuracy**.  
AI-generated content does **not adhere to style guides**, which are essential for maintaining a consistent brand and voice.

While **prompt engineering** can improve output to an extent, a **human-in-the-loop** is necessary to ensure:

- Clarity  
- Accuracy  
- Usability  

---

## ðŸ’¬ "So you are a content writer? Our marketing team can also do that."

**Answer:**  
Marketing and technical content serve **entirely different purposes**.

- **Marketers** use persuasive language to attract and convert users.  
- **Technical writers** provide factual, structured, and user-centric documentation.

We donâ€™t create content on the flyâ€”we follow the **7 Cs of effective communication** to ensure:

- Clarity  
- Conciseness  
- Consistency  
- Correctness  
- Coherence  
- Completeness  
- Courtesy

## ðŸ’¬ "Our developers can do a better job because they are technically sound."

**Answer:**  
A developerâ€™s job is to **build the product**, not document it.  
A technical writer ensures the **end user** understands and uses the product effectively.

To illustrate this:

> In the show *Indiaâ€™s Got Latent*, a participant was asked to explain software engineering to a 5-year-old.  
> Every time he used terms like API, server, or database, the host became frustrated.  
> The participant finally admitted he only knew how to code.  
>  
> **This highlights the need for technical writers**â€”professionals who simplify complex concepts for any audience.

## ðŸ’¬ "Your job is just to write, right?"

**Answer:**  
Writing is only **10%** of a technical writerâ€™s job.

The other **90%** includes:

- Research  
- Structuring content  
- Collaborating with SMEs  
- Maintaining consistency  
- Enhancing user experience  
- Reducing support overhead

We donâ€™t just writeâ€”we create **guides, references, and walkthroughs** that **solve problems**.

---

## ðŸ’¬ "Why do we need full-time technical writers? Canâ€™t we just update documentation when needed?"

**Answer:**  
Letâ€™s reverse the question:  
> **Why do you need full-time developers? Canâ€™t they just update the code when necessary?**

Documentation should **evolve alongside the product**.

If you update documentation only occasionally:

- It becomes outdated  
- Users get confused  
- Support tickets increase  
- User adoption decreases

Good documentation requires **continuous maintenance**, just like software.

# âœ… Proving Your Value as a Technical Writer

I follow what my former manager **Ajay Tripathi** used to do when under pressure from leadership:  
> **Respond with data.**

When you **prove value with data**, you donâ€™t need to explain further.

### Hereâ€™s how you can demonstrate value:

- âœ… Integrate documentation with **Google Analytics**  
  â†’ Track page views, time spent, and bounce rates.

- âœ… Measure **support ticket deflection**  
  â†’ Show how documentation reduced the need for customer support.

- âœ… Showcase great documentation as **inspiration**  
  â†’ Stripe, Paystack, and PayPal treat documentation **as a product**.

- âœ… Share **before and after examples**  
  â†’ Unstructured vs. structured documentation  
  â†’ Confusing vs. easy-to-use guides

- âœ… **Collaborate cross-functionally**  
  â†’ Work with Developers, QA, and PMs to integrate docs into the **dev workflow**.
