It’s not just developers who can use git for version-controlling their code. As technical writers, we can contribute as well through `git` for product documentation.

Let’s push the boundaries and ask a bold question:

> **What if we applied the same rigor and automation to _all_ product documentation — not just APIs?**

- Documentation is often siloed.  
- It’s inconsistent.  
- And too often, it’s invisible to the development process.

But it doesn’t have to be.

Imagine treating your docs with the same care you give your code:

- Versioned in Git  
- Reviewed via Pull Requests  
- Linted using CLI tools for style guides and grammar  
- Auto-deployed via CI/CD  

That’s the power of the **Docs-as-Code** approach — applied across **all kinds of documentation**, not just developer guides.

## Watch the Docs Pipeline in Action

I created an animated visual to illustrate what a modern, automated documentation workflow looks like.

We’re talking about 6 core stages — each automated and integrated into your DevOps process:

**Plan → Write → Lint → Review → Preview → Publish**

---

###  Plan  
Start with a **prioritized list of documentation tasks**, aligned with real product work. Use tools like **Jira** or **Trello** to track and sync content with sprint cycles.  
This ensures you're writing **what matters** — and **why** it matters.

---

###  Write  
Draft in markup languages including **Markdown**, **AsciiDoc**, or using any lightweight editor.  This keeps your content versionable, diffable, and developer-friendly.

Bonus? Writers and developers can work in the same environment.

---

###  Lint  
Enforce consistency with **[Vale CLI](https://vale.sh/docs/cli)** and tools like  **[DocDetective](https://github.com/doc-detective/doc-detective)**(I am still experimenting Doc Detective).  
These tools check for grammar, tone, and style guide violations like **Grammarly for docs**, but programmable and CI-friendly.

No more “check manually before merge” chaos. And again, who will remember a style guide that spans over 100 pages. I can't...

---

###  Review  
Submit docs through **Pull Requests**, collect **inline comments**, and review asynchronously.  
Just like code.  
This brings documentation out of the shadows and into the dev conversation.

---

###  Preview  
Auto-generate a **live preview** of your documentation site using static site generators like:

- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)  
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)  
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)  

Stakeholders can now review **how the docs will look**  not just read raw Markdown.

---

### Publish  
Once approved, your CI/CD pipeline **automatically deploys the site**.  
Whether it's **Netlify**, **GitHub Pages**, **Gitlab Pipelines**, or **Vercel**, there’s no need for manual uploads or clunky PDF attachments.

Click. Browse. Done.

##  The Stack That Makes It Work

A modern docs pipeline is powered by tools like:

-  **Markdown** – Lightweight, readable formats  
-  **Git / GitLab** – Version control + PRs  
-  **Vale CLI / DocDetective** – Linting and quality control  
-  **Docusaurus** – Static site generators  
-  **CI/CD (Gitlab Pipelines)** – Automated deployment

##  Final Thoughts

Docs-as-Code isn’t just for API teams anymore.  
It’s a mindset shift for **every kind of product documentation**.

You don’t need a huge team.  
Just a willingness to think like a dev and treat your words like code.

Ready to build a documentation pipeline that scales as your product grows?

Let’s ditch the silos and embrace automation.

## Real-World Considerations

While the Docs-as-Code approach offers major benefits, it's important to acknowledge that it may not suit every team or documentation type equally. 

Here are a few real-world considerations:

- **Not One-Size-Fits-All**: Highly visual content, enterprise level documentation, or teams without technical resources may prefer traditional workflows. That’s okay — Docs-as-Code is a mindset, not a mandate.

- **Tooling Overhead**: Setting up CI/CD, linters, and previews can be overwhelming for small teams. Start simple, even just versioning your docs in Git is a great step forward. 

- **Learning Curve**: Writers unfamiliar with Git or PR workflows might feel intimidated. Tools like GitHub Desktop or pairing with developers can ease adoption.

- **Developer Mindset Assumptions**: You don’t need to become a developer — just embrace a workflow that values collaboration, versioning, and continuous improvement.
