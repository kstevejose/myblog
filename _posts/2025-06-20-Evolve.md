# Should We Start Using AI Tools or Continue Traditional Documentation Methods?

This is the question you need to ask yourself.

**How are we still relevant in an industry experiencing rapid AI evolution?**

That’s because LLMs are only as good as:  
> **"Garbage in, Garbage Out."**

They don't understand the audience, the pain points, or have any context of the product being documented.

---

## So What Does This Mean for You?

Should you continue with traditional documentation methods?  
**Not entirely.**

Let AI **automate repetitive, low-value tasks**, so you can focus on **high-value work**.

---

## What Are High-Value Tasks?

These include:

- Developing innovative ideas  
- Improving workflows  
- Collaborating with developers and stakeholders

---

### But I’m a Technical Writer. I’ve Done Documentation All My Life.  
**How Can I Learn All These New Things?**

So you don’t want to evolve or grow?  
Are you letting experience be a **foundation** or a **comfort zone**?

Many industry veterans with decades of experience still continue to learn and adapt.  
Why?  
Because there's **always room for growth and new skills**.

---

> **Ok, I will start learning now...**

This is a **fictional dialogue** inspired by a real-world scenario of me talking to my inner self —  
more like Swami Nityananda's words:

> _"Me resides in this as Me, as Me is residing in all of that as Me, so that Me, through this Me, is talking to Me."_

## My Real Journey

I used to do my documentation on **Google Docs** because that’s what was offered by the company.  
Over time, it started getting on my nerves due to the variety of documentation types I was handling.

Then, the company began encouraging the use of **LLMs**.

So, I went above and beyond to make the best use of AI in my daily work.

I know **only 0.00000000000000000000001%** about AI,  
but even that was enough to **boost my productivity**.

Now imagine if that number reaches just **a hundred**.

---

## What Changed?

I began leveraging the **prompt engineering knowledge** I gained over the months:

- Implemented **Docusaurus**  
- Adopted **OpenAPI**  
- Introduced **Docs-as-Code** framework

Whenever PMs asked me to draft documents for external stakeholders,  
I used **Gemini (pre-integrated in GSuite)** with my prompt engineering skills  
to structure content and refine weak sections.

Another win:  
I discovered the **OpenAPI bundling process**, which helped extend specs to clients  
with minimal changes — only a few additional params.

---

These are **just a few examples** of what I brought to the table  
**as a technical writer equipped with AI skills.**

Now place yourself in my shoes.  
**What could YOU achieve?**

---

Without AI, I would still be busy **formatting PM documents**.  
My growth would’ve been **stagnant**.

**LLMs freed up my time** and allowed me to focus on **strategy, visibility, and high-value contributions**.

---

# So the Real Question:

> **Would you rather dissolve or evolve?**

Visibility lies in the latter...

This article is AI-generated —  
but you can run it through any AI detection tool and it’ll say:  
**"Human-generated."**
