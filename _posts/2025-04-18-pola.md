# How Music Production Taught Me About Usability and Documentation

Back in my college days, I had to **commute over 3 hours daily** to and from college. To make the time worthwhile, I started listening to **A State of Trance (ASOT)** regularly. I was always curious about how music is produced—and being in Mumbai, I had plenty of ways to explore it.

That's around the time DJs were beginning to rise. Some of them, who had once dropped out of school, are now famous.  
**Life, yeah...?**

## My First Encounter with FL Studio

I discovered that most DJs and producers use a tool called **FL Studio** to create music like **EDM, Trance, and Dubstep**.

Once I got my hands on the software, I went into **binge-learning mode**, watching tutorial after tutorial.  
Within a year, I had a solid grasp of the **fundamentals of music production**, even though I didn’t pursue mastery at the time.

But one thing stuck:  
Whenever I explore any **music or video editing tool**—I pick it up fast.  
Why?

## The Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)

> **"The principle of least astonishment (POLA) states that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave, minimizing confusion and surprise."** – *Wikipedia*

Let’s say I try using **Camtasia**, **Premiere Pro**, or **Shotcut**.

If these tools didn’t follow similar design principles as FL Studio—like **timelines**, **playlists**, **drag-and-drop**,**layering**—I’d struggle. I might even drop them entirely.

> **"Every extra step you make a user take reduces adoption."** – *Steve Krug* (not me!)

Another small but powerful example:  
**Pressing `CTRL + D` to duplicate** works across many tools.  
That consistency **reduces learning friction**.

## Why Consistency in Documentation Matters

Let’s assume you’re a technical writer for a product called **Alien Listener Keyboard**—a futuristic web keyboard to help humans communicate with **intergalactic visitors**.

Recently, the company **updated the keyboard alphabets**:  
From `A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H` to `I, J, K, L, M, N, O`.

### Now Meet Rohit:

A long-time user, Rohit, presses `A`—as per the old design—but nothing happens.  
He searches the documentation, which still refers to `A`.  
Frustrated, he gives up...  
And **fails to contact Jadoo**.

---

## The Lesson?

Had the **documentation team** been informed about the update,  
Rohit would have had a better experience, and maybe even **established first contact**.

## Have You Faced This?

Have you ever struggled with **outdated documentation** that didn’t reflect the product's latest changes?

If yes, you already understand how powerful **accurate, updated, and intuitive documentation** can be.
