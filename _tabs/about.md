I’m a Senior Technical Writer with a mission to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and real human understanding. I specialize in creating clear, scalable, and future-focused documentation, especially around APIs, developer tools, and AI integrations.

My work goes beyond writing. I explore how LLMs, automation, and Docs-as-Code practices can transform the way we build, manage, and experience technical content. From building OpenAPI-based documentation systems to designing workflows that integrate linting, validation, and CI/CD, I bring both clarity and efficiency to the documentation process.

Online, I share engaging GIFs, carousels, and visuals that educate and inspire technical writers to embrace the evolving role of AI in their craft. My content blends insight with creativity—often drawing thousands of impressions by turning technical ideas into visual stories that stick.

If you're thinking about where documentation is headed, I’m already building it.
